# password-generator
The goal of this project is to create an application that will allow the generation of a random password based on user-selected criteria.

__Use Instructions__

To operate this application, the user will simply need to click on the "Generate Password" button.

Once clicked, the user will be asked a series of parameters that they would like the password to conform to.  

First, the password lenght is selected.
![Choose pasword length](./assets/images/Step2.png)

The passwword lenght cannot be left empty, cannot be outside of the minimum/maximum length and must be numeric.  
![Validate password length entry](./assets/images/Step3.png)

The user cannot proceed until these conditions are met.

The user will then select the types of characters that the password will consist of.

![Include Numeric Characters](./assets/images/Step6.png)

![Include Special Characters](./assets/images/Step7.png)

The application will require the user to select at least one of available character sets to build their password with.
